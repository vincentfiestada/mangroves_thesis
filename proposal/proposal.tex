%Abstract
\begin{abstract}
Mangrove forests along tropical coastlines frequently suffer severe damage due to storms. The mangrove trees themselves are extremely sensitive to environmental stressors such as water salinity and tidal inundation. We propose an agent-based model for the prediction of the regenerative behavior of mangrove stands consisting of multiple species and a fragmented habitat, with the addition of spatio-temporal colored noise for added stochasticity.

\section{Introduction}
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Mangroves are trees and shrubs that live in the coastal intertidal zone. Its roots provide habitat to various aquatic organisms. Mangroves are used in flavouring agents, textiles, housing, and more.\\ 
Mangrove seedlings can float and take root once it finds ground, and can disperse and grow far away from parent tree. Some species have seeds that develop while still attached to the parent plant, and break off afterwards.
Some mangroves have been known to live for more than 100 years. Most trees will never reach this age because of various factors that could affect its growth and mortality, e.g. tidal inundation, salinity, competition between other mangroves, and the presence of storms.

\section{Objectives of the Study}
The study aims to project the growth of heterospecific mangrove populations	living in a fragmented habitat. The target use case of the model is in predicting the success or failure of mangrove restoration strategies given the type of habitat, the species that inhabit it, the species that will be planted, and locations of mangrove stands.
