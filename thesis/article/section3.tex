External coloured noises may influence field systems, including diffusion
processes. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are a simple and commonly-used
category of non-white noise whose evolution is governed by the following
differential equation \cite{ojalvoColoredNoise}.

\[\dot{\xi}(r,t) = \frac{1}{\tau}(1 - \lambda^{2}\nabla^{2})\xi(r,t) + \frac{1}{\tau}\omega(t)\]

where \(\omega(t)\)is a white noise term. \(\tau\) is the
\emph{correlation time} and \(\lambda\) is the \emph{correlation length}.
