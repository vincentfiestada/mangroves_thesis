\label{cha:submission}

\section{General Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item Graduating students are required to submit \textbf{three (3) bound copies} of their undergraduate research manuscript. An electronic copy of their manuscripts, as well as codes and/or data used in the research, if any, should be uploaded to the repository link assigned to you.
\item The manuscript should be printed on a \textbf{A4 size paper}. Moreover, the cover should be hard bound in \textbf{green} cloth and embossed in gold. Refer to the format of the front and side bound cover of the thesis in Sections \ref{sec:front} and \ref{sec:side}.
\item The manuscript should include a title page, approval sheet and an IPR page. The approval sheet should be signed by the thesis adviser(s) and the chair of the Department of Computer Science. The IPR page should be signed by the student and the thesis adviser.  After the approval sheet is accomplished, all the bound copies are surrendered to the laboratory head.
\item The deadline for submission of the manuscript and CD is on the last day of submission of grades for the term in which the student(s) expects to graduate, unless an earlier date is posted by the thesis adviser.
\end{itemize}

\section{Format of Front Cover of Bound Manuscript}
\label{sec:front}
The following information (Times New Roman font size 16, center justified) should be found on the front bound cover of
the thesis properly spaced.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Title (in capital letters)
\item Name of student(s) (in capital letters). For more than one student, the names should be arranged alphabetically, and separated by a line space.
\item Affiliation of the student(s), i.e.
{\ssp\begin{center}
DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE\\
College of Engineering\\
University of the Philippines\\
Diliman, Quezon City
\end{center}}
\item Month and year of submission (in capital letters)
\end{enumerate}


\section{Format of Spine of Bound Manuscript}
\label{sec:side}
The following information (in capital letters) should be found on the side bound cover of the thesis, properly spaced, bounded by two vertical lines and separated by a single vertical line.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initial of the student's first and middle name each followed by a period and then the student's full last name.
\item Title of the thesis. If the whole title of the thesis will not fit, only the first words that will fit followed by an ellipsis will suffice.
\item Degree and the program in two lines, i.e. ``BS CS" 
\item Year of submission preceded by the initial of the University of the Philippines in two lines, i.e., ``20xx UP".
