External coloured noises may influence field systems, including diffusion processes. These are particularly useful in cases where a random field has non-zero correlation between different points in space and time. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are a simple and commonly-used category of non-white noise whose evolution is governed by the following differential equation \cite{ojalvoColoredNoise}

\[\dot{\xi}(r,t) = \frac{1}{\tau}(1 - \lambda^{2}\nabla^{2})\xi(r,t) + \frac{1}{\tau}\omega(t)\]

where \(\omega(t)\)is a white noise term (i.e., not spatially dependent). \(\tau\) is the \emph{correlation time} and \(\lambda\) is the \emph{correlation length}. The two correlation parameters are measures of the noise's memory in time and space, respectively.
