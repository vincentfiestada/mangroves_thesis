\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

The SCL \LaTeX\ undergraduate research manuscript style file, available for download at {\tt http://scl.dcs.upd.edu.ph/internal}, can be used
to produce either an undergraduate research manuscript with a format that follows the guidelines set by the College of Engineering.
The style file allows you to generate:
\begin{itemize}
\item title page
\item approval sheet
\item intellectual property rights (IPR) page
\item abstract
\item copyright page \textit{(optional)}
\item lists of contents (table of contents, list of tables, and list of figures)
\item acknowledgment, preface, etc.
\item chapters with numbered headings and subheadings
\item bibliography
\item appendices
\end{itemize}

The style file described in this document can be used on any system
with \LaTeX, which includes Windows machines, Macs, or Linux/Unix systems. It is assumed that you know how to run \LaTeX\  on your system.


\section{Using the Class File}
To use the style file on your personal computer, you first need to download the appropriate zip file at {\tt http://scl.dcs.upd.edu.ph/internal} and extract\\ \texttt{scl-ug-manuscript.cls} and {\tt UPnotations.sty}. You can either put it in the folder with your research materials
(to use it only with documents in that folder), or place it in the standard \LaTeX\ input path
for your system, along with all the other files that end in \texttt{.cls} or \texttt{.sty}.

If you are using the TeXLive system on a Windows machine and
have installed under {\tt C:\textbackslash TeXLive20xx}, the folder name will be:

\begin{center}
{\tt C:\textbackslash TeXLive20xx\textbackslash texmf-local\textbackslash tex\textbackslash latex\textbackslash thesis\textbackslash}.
\end{center}
