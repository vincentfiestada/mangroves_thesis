\chapter{Methodology}
The following serves as a description of the Overview, Design Concepts, and Details of the proposed model. The ODD is a standardised protocol used to describe agent-based models. It includes a detailed explanation of how each step in the simulation is carried out, what agents are being simulated, the effects of the virtual environment as well as the effects of the agents on each other.
